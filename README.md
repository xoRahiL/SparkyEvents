Backend Architecture & Model Design:

The project follows Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture well, separating logic and ensuring maintainability.
Effective use of Django models for handling event-related data with appropriate relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) showcases your understanding of database modeling.
User Authentication:

The project includes a login and registration system, showing you can handle user authentication and manage permissions.
If you’ve implemented additional security measures, like password hashing or email verification, these are valuable points to mention.
Event-Specific Features:

Your project includes key functionality tailored to event management, such as scheduling, booking, or tracking attendance.
If there are unique features like reminders, notifications, or automatic updates for users, these emphasize your ability to create user-oriented functionalities.
Frontend Skills:

The use of Django templates, HTML, CSS (or Bootstrap), and JavaScript demonstrates that you can manage the user interface and create a responsive design.
Highlighting any specific JavaScript functionality, such as dynamic updates or interactive elements, would strengthen this point.
Database and Query Optimization:

Utilizing Django’s ORM for queries shows proficiency in handling relational databases.
If you’ve optimized queries or implemented caching, that’s a great example of backend optimization.
