• With this project, my goal was to create a platform that directly connects Clients with event organizers,
eliminating the need for middlemen and their associated commission fees.
• I envisioned a streamlined process where workers could showcase their skills and availability, while
organizers could easily find and hire suitable workers for their events.
• By cutting out the middlemen, the platform aimed to make event organization more cost-effective for
organizers and increase earnings for workers.
• This project was designed to accommodate numerous workers from various backgrounds, rather than
being limited to employees of a single company.
• The platform aimed to provide opportunities for freelance workers , part-time workers , and those
looking for temporary event-related jobs , thus creating a more inclusive and diverse pool of workers
for event organizers to choose from
